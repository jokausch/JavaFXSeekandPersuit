# JavaFX  - Steering Behaviors For Autonomous Characters 

This programs is an example of boid´s steering behaviour described first by 
Craig Reynold (Steering Behaviors For Autonomous Characters)
https://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/

It shows flocking behavior based upon "separate", "align" and "cohesion" for all
the boids and "persuit" for the two "hunters".

Thanks to the great work of Daniel Shiffman (http://www.shiffman.net) I was able to 
implement some of those algorithms with JavaFX. This sources are based on his 
examples (using processing - https://processing.org)

I also enclosed is the PVector class from processing (https://www.processing.org/) 
and a small helper (Util) class for eg. creating random numbers.
